      <h2>Our Business Pillars</h2>
      <h3>Existing State of Affairs</h3>
      <p>
        As climate change intensifies, agriculture faces growing threats. Rising
        temperatures and extreme weather events are putting farmers and their
        crops at risk.
      </p>
      <p>Sustainability is no longer a differentiator, it’s the baseline.</p>

      <h3>Transformative Future</h3>
      <p>
        We need to transform farming practices to guarantee a livable planet in
        the next few decades and enough food to feed a growing population.
      </p>
